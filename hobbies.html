    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy creative writing and blogging as a way to express ideas and connect with others. I’m passionate about health and wellness, actively exploring nutrition and lifestyle changes to support both my family and personal well-being. I also love experimenting with web and graphic design in my spare time, often working on personal or community projects to stay creatively inspired. Travel and discovering different cultures fuel my creativity, and I’m deeply involved in faith-based community activities, including teaching and volunteering. Continuous learning through reading, online courses, and self-development programs is also a key part of my lifestyle.</p>
